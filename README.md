Under the administrative control of the Culture, Tourism, Antiquities & Archives Department, Government of Sindh.

## Overview
The **Sindhi WordNet Tagging Dataset** contains a collection of Sindhi words, annotated with various linguistic features such as categories, tenses, synonyms, antonyms, and more. This dataset is designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly for tasks such as word sense disambiguation, semantic analysis, and syntactic tagging for the Sindhi language.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains the following columns:

1. **word_id**: A unique identifier for each word entry.
2. **word**: The Sindhi word.
3. **category**: The part of speech or syntactic category of the word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
4. **gender**: The gender associated with the word (if applicable).
5. **invariants**: Information about whether the word is invariant (e.g., whether it has plural or singular forms).
6. **tags**: The syntactic or semantic tag associated with the word (e.g., conjunction, preposition).
7. **tenses**: The tense information for the word (if applicable).
8. **hyp**: Any hypernyms associated with the word.
9. **antonyms**: Antonyms for the word (if available).
10. **synonyms**: Synonyms for the word (if available).

## Features
- **Comprehensive word annotations** for various linguistic categories.
- **Multiple syntactic and semantic features** such as tense, gender, synonyms, and antonyms.
- **Designed for Sindhi NLP** tasks, helping improve language processing for the Sindhi language.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for a wide range of NLP tasks such as:
- **Part-of-speech tagging**.
- **Word sense disambiguation**.
- **Semantic analysis**.

You can load and process this dataset using any standard CSV reader in your preferred programming language (e.g., Python's `pandas`).
